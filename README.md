# Nova Kyiv eShop

**Welcome everyone!**

**Nova Kyiv eShop** is a fully functional e-commerce store where users can find and purchase the products they need. This project was created to showcase my skills in building large and complex projects.

## Key Features:
- **Language Interface**: The website uses Ukrainian as the primary language, but English can be added upon request. The main functionality for this has already been implemented, so English support may be added in the future.
- **Technologies**: The project is built using React and TypeScript, with a backend powered by Node.js.
- **Capabilities**: Users can browse products, add them to the cart, and make purchases.

## Project Goal:
This project was created to demonstrate my web application development skills and showcase the capabilities of modern technologies. I hope this work finds its audience and that someone will start their journey with React and TypeScript with a Node.js backend through my website. In return, I hope it brings me the dream job I aspire to!

Thank you for your attention!
